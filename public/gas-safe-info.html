                To make sure that gas appliances such as boilers, fires, ovens and hobs are fitted, fixed and serviced safely, only a Gas Safe registered engineer should carry out the work. If someone other than a Gas Safe registered engineer undertakes gas work, they are breaking the law and could put lives at risk.<br><br>

                To prove they are legally permitted to work on gas, all Gas Safe registered engineers have an ID card with their own unique licence number and a photograph.

            <div class="des-para" style="font-weight: 500;">Dysons Plumbing and Heating is supporting Gas Safe Register’s ‘Let’s Talk Gas Safety’ campaign for the elderly. To find out more visit <a class="des-para" style="font-weight: 500;" href="www.GasSafeRegister.co.uk/elderly">www.GasSafeRegister.co.uk/elderly</a></div>
        
            <div class="des-label">Older people's campaign</div>

            <div class="des-above">Overview</div>
            <div class="des-para">Gas Safe Register runs the official list of qualified gas engineers who can legally and safety work on gas appliances. Recent research carried out by Gas Safe Register has identified the over 65 age group as having low awareness levels of gas safety.  Therefore, our next public awareness campaign, Let’s Talk Gas Safety, aims to increase the gas safety awareness of this particularly vulnerable audience.</div>
        
            <div class="des-above">Who?</div>
            <div class="des-para">The campaign will target over 65s. There will be a national roll out as well as a burst of activity in the North East as this area has been identified as being particularly vulnerable and has the highest levels of fuel poverty in this age group.</div>
        
            <div class="des-above">Why?</div>
            <div class="des-para" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">From current research we know that there is low gas safety awareness in this age group.</div>

            <ul class="des-list">
                <li class="des-point">They are less likely to know there is a gas registration scheme and make proper checks that the engineer is registered, and they are more likely to trust a recommendation or paperwork.</li>
                <li class="des-point">They have lower knowledge of symptoms of CO and that it can’t be seen or smelt.They are likely to be more vulnerable to the effects of CO poisoning.</li>
                <li class="des-point">They are vulnerable from a behaviour point of view – they may have a tendency to keep using old appliances, use them in the wrong way, or try to fix them themselves.  </li>
                <li class="des-point">There may be financial constraints and they cannot always afford regular servicing or repairs.  </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="des-above">When?</div>
            <div class="des-para">‍The campaign launched in January 2011.    </div>

            <div class="des-above">How?</div>
            <div class="des-para" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">‍The Let’s Talk Gas Safety campaign focuses around the conversations older people like to have over a cup of tea and encourages them to talk about gas safety. Gas Safe Register staff will talk with them about gas safety and key messages such as explaining what Gas Safe Register is, to always use a Gas Safe registered engineer, how they can find an engineer, gas safety risks and carbon monoxide information, and the need for annual gas safety checks etc. We’ll encourage them to talk to their engineer and ask for the Gas Safe ID card and talk to each other and pass on gas safety information. We will use various methods, initially through the pilot to see what is effective, including:</div>
            <ul class="des-list">
                <li class="des-point">Leafleting  – large print leaflets with pertinent gas safety information will be distributed by door drops and partners.</li>
                <li class="des-point">Advertising – newspaper, magazine and Post Office advertising.</li>
                <li class="des-point">Community events – We will utilise events to mobilise the older generation to think and talk about gas safety. Talking to them face to face as its one of the best ways to reach this audience. We will hold Gas Safe Tea Party events with local organisations - a chance to talk about gas safety over a cup of tea. There will be a gas safety presentation and giveaways such as tea bags and fridge magnets featuring the ID card.</li>
                <li class="des-point">Media coverage – High profile PR event to generate media coverage. There will be a news story featuring new research around the elderly to launch the campaign. We will also work with media partners.</li>
            </ul>
